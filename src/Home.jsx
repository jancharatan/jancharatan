          Although I was born in Portland, Oregon, I've also lived in Dresden, Germany and San Jose, California. I'm interested in 
          frontend development using React (what I used to make this webpage!). Some of my other interests include soccer, poker, skiing,

      </div>
      <MyFooter />
    </div>
    
  );
}

export default Home;
